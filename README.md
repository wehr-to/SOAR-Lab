# ⚙️ SOAR Lab — Security Orchestration & Automation

This repository simulates real-world SOAR (Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response) workflows, playbooks, and tool integrations. It's designed for analysts and engineers building hands-on automation skills.

## 🎯 Why This Repo Exists

SOAR isn’t just a buzzword — it’s a mindset. Teams that automate intelligently:
- Move faster
- Reduce alert fatigue
- Scale operations without burning out

This repo provides:
- Modular, testable SOAR playbooks
- Integrations with tools like TheHive, Cortex, Splunk, and Slack
- Code snippets for Python, PowerShell, and API automation

## 📂 Folder Structure

| Folder               | Description |
|----------------------|-------------|
| `playbooks/`         | Step-by-step incident response automations (YAML, Markdown) |
| `integrations/`      | Scripts for API integrations (e.g. VirusTotal, AbuseIPDB, Slack) |
| `helpers/`           | Python/PowerShell functions and re-usable blocks |
| `simulated-alerts/`  | Mock alerts used to trigger workflows (JSON, CSV) |
| `docs/`              | Conceptual explanations, architecture diagrams, use cases |
| `testing/`           | Lab environment notes, dry-run tests, edge case reviews |

## 🛠 Tools You Can Plug In
- TheHive / Cortex
- Splunk / ELK
- CrowdStrike / SentinelOne APIs
- Slack / Teams
- VirusTotal / URLHaus / AbuseIPDB

## 📣 Signal Sent
This repo shows you:
- Think in **systems and workflows**
- Can automate without blindly trusting tools
- Understand **incident response, tooling, and architecture**
- Are ready for detection engineering, SOC automation, or SecOps roles

## 📜 Legal
Never test automation against real systems without permission. Mock alerts and data are strongly recommended for lab environments.

> "Don't just respond. Orchestrate." — This repo helps you go from manual to scalable.
